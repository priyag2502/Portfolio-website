                    <h1>About Me:</h1>
                    <p>I have been coding since class 9 and since then it is my most favourite subject and the reason why I love studying. Over the years, I have learnt JAVA, HTML, CSS, C, C++, Python and JS.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Out of all the languages I have learnt yet JAVA, HTML and CSS have stood out the most for me.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>JAVA - It was through JAVA I discovered my love and passion for coding and I never looked back since.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>HTML & CSS - It's through these languages I can bring my imagination to reality and it's a beautiful feeling. These languages have given me the wings to fly I never had and they have given me the liberty to be even more imaginative.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I have found a safe space in coding which I never found in people, places and things.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>It's been a beautiful journey of learning so many languagues and I want to learn and explore more in this field. I want to create beautiful things and I want to make this world even more beautiful and simple to live in.</p>
